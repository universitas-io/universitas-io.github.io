Data collection and analysis service for quantitative research using `Python` or `R`.

We can collect data from various sources, such as YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, X/Twitter, and other platforms, using advanced `web scraping` and `APIs`. Additionally, we can help organize this data into structured databases to facilitate further analysis, all with the methodological rigor required for cutting-edge research.

- Multivariate analysis of textual and quantitative data.
- Data visualization for clear and impactful insights.
- Sentiment analysis and trends on social media.
- Statistical modeling and machine learning to predict behaviors and patterns.
- Clustering and data segmentation to identify groups and emerging trends.
- Support in interpreting results and writing scientific articles.
- Database structuring to facilitate data management and analysis.
- Descriptive and inferential statistics to support your conclusions.
